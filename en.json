In 2019 we created ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¾ Urutienda, where I've been working as a WordPress Developer since then. In 2022 I started teaching Web Development at the digital academy Coderhouse. Then, I created my YouTube channel as a place to upload extra content for my students, and it has evolved into what is today: a channel with a lot of videos and courses about HTML, CSS and JavaScript, reaching 16500 subscribers. I recently moved to ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸ Spain, in search of challenges, opportunities and new projects."
